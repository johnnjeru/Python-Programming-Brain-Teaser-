This repository focuses on solving the most common pressing questions with Python programming. 

# Introdution 
Building a grading system is crucial for various educational institutions for easy retrieval and analysis of results. Building an interactive and robust grade system saves time and provides flexibility to adapt to changes. This repository focuses on building such an interactive grade system that can perform diverse activities and be changed when needed. 

# Challenge 
Using Python programming language, I built an interactive grading system that accepts assignments, homework, and three exam inputs to compute any student's course grade.
