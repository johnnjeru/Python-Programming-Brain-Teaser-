# Python-Programming Building an Interactive Grading System-
This repository focuses on solving the most common pressing questions with Python programming. 

# Introdution 
Building a grading system is crucial for various educational institutions for easy retrieval and analysis of results. Building an interactive and robust grade system saves time and provides flexibility to adapt to changes. This repository focuses on building such an interactive grade system that can perform diverse activities and be changed when needed. 

# Challenge 
Using Python programming language, I built an interactive grading system that accepts assignments, homework, and three exam inputs to compute any student's course grade. The program begins with an introduction and what it can achieve. The program considers three tests, the mid-term 1 exam, mid-term 2 exam, homework, and final exams. Each of these tests is weighted differently but the final grade should be out of 100. The weights are provided by the user through a prompt. 

## Mid Term 1
The program requests the mid-term 1 scores and also asks if the exam was shifted or not (1 if it was shifted and 0 otherwise). In case of a shift the program further asks the amount shifted and adds the shifted scores to the mid-term 1 scores.
